# Security Guide

## Docker Security Fixes Applied

### Base Image Updates

- **Updated**: `python:3.11-slim` → `python:3.12-slim`
- **Reason**: Latest Python version with security patches
- **Impact**: Resolves known vulnerabilities in older Python versions

### System Dependencies

- **Replaced**: `netcat-traditional` → `netcat-openbsd` (more secure)
- **Added**: `ca-certificates` for secure TLS connections
- **Enhanced**: Comprehensive cleanup of temporary files and caches

### Python Security

- **Added**: `pip check` to validate dependency integrity
- **Updated**: Latest pip, setuptools, and wheel versions
- **Secured**: User-level package installation

### Build Security

- **Created**: `.dockerignore` to reduce attack surface
- **Minimized**: Only essential files in Docker context
- **Hardened**: Non-root user execution throughout

### CI/CD Security

- **Enhanced**: Trivy scanner with fail-on-critical setting
- **Added**: Exit code 1 for CRITICAL/HIGH vulnerabilities
- **Improved**: Always upload scan results for visibility

## Security Best Practices

### Container Security

1. **Non-root execution**: All processes run as `appuser`
2. **Minimal attack surface**: Only required packages installed
3. **Regular updates**: Automated security patches via CI/CD
4. **Vulnerability scanning**: Trivy integration in pipeline

### Secret Management

1. **No hardcoded secrets**: All secrets via environment variables
2. **Template-based**: Secret manifests require external injection
3. **Runtime injection**: Secrets loaded at container startup

### Network Security

1. **Health checks**: Built-in application health monitoring
2. **Timeout controls**: Proper timeout settings for all probes
3. **TLS ready**: CA certificates included for secure connections

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Vulnerability Detection

- **Trivy scanning**: Every build scanned for vulnerabilities
- **GitHub Security**: Results uploaded to Security tab
- **Fail-fast**: Pipeline fails on critical vulnerabilities

### Runtime Security

- **Health monitoring**: Docker health checks and monitoring endpoints
- **Resource limits**: Docker container resource constraints prevent resource exhaustion
- **Container isolation**: Docker networking provides secure container isolation

This security implementation follows industry best practices and provides multiple layers of protection.
