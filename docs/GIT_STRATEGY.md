## 🔍 Example Commit Messages

### Good Examples

```bash
feat(auth): implement JWT token refresh endpoint

Add endpoint for refreshing expired JWT tokens with proper
validation and error handling.

Closes #15

---

perf(movies): add Redis caching for trending movies

Implement Redis caching for trending movies endpoint to reduce
TMDb API calls and improve response time by 60%.

- Cache duration: 30 minutes
- Cache key pattern: trending_movies_{page}
- Fallback to API if cache miss

---

test(favorites): add comprehensive tests for user favorites

Add unit and integration tests covering:
- Adding movies to favorites
- Removing movies from favorites
- Retrieving user favorites list
- Edge cases and error handling

Coverage increased from 85% to 92%
```

### Bad Examples (Avoid These)

```bash
# Too vague
fix: bug fix

# No description
feat: add stuff

# Not following convention
Added new feature for users

# Too long without body
feat: implement comprehensive user authentication system with JWT tokens, refresh tokens, user registration, login, logout, profile management, password reset functionality, email verification, and security middleware
```
